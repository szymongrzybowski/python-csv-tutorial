# python-csv-tutorial
This tutorial contains basic knowledge about Python CSV library. As well as code and examples. It was created for novice programmers.

The aim of this tutorial is to bring a more detailed and an easier guide for beginners. It is suggested to read official Python CSV docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).

Every file starts with step-by-step explanation. In the second part of the file there is a complete code.

I recommend to start with file_reading.py and then file_writing.py. Append_to_file.py is almost identical to file_writing.py.

Setup:
Windows 10
Python 3.8.1
